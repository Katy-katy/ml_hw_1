we tried some different models on two datasets

we took data from these two Kaggel competitions:

Data Set 1: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
Data Set 2: https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data

For the both notebooks we used only corresponding train.csv (we split it into train/test)
